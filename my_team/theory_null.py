"""YOUR THEORY GOES HERE.

This file is your team's core intellectual contribution: it translates your
Section 4 theoretical analysis (see the project manual) into (1) explicit
belief features and (2) a training objective. WHAT to compute in each hook
is exactly the content of your Section 4 work — this template only shows
you WHERE it plugs in. Edit it, then train:

    python scripts/train.py --theory submission_template/theory.py \
        --team "your-team-name" --out submission.pt

The environment itself (see/config.py, see/env.py) is FIXED — the
tournament runs the canonical game for everyone. Everything you are allowed
to condition on is in your own observation vector and the public state:

obs indices (see see/env.py for the full layout):
    0 t/T_bar | 1 own rho | 2 own m_hat | 3 own e_hat | 4 own K/4
    5 opp K/4 | 6 own last sigma | 7 opp last sigma | 8 mediation
    9 self active | 10 opp active | 11 opp high-signal freq
    12 opp mean sigma | 13 own mean sigma | 14 own phi spend/20
    15 own G/e0

public_state dict:
    t, T_bar, K, last_sigma, mediation, active,
    history = [{t, sigma:{I,U}, action:{I,U}, exit:{I,U}, mediation}, ...]

You may use anything in `obs` and `public_state` (your own private state +
the public history). You have NO access to the opponent's type or
endurance. See `see/training/theory_api.py` for the full contract.

This template ships as a NULL theory: no extra features, no shaping — it
trains against the plain environment reward and is a valid (if weak)
submission as-is. Replace the two methods below with your own analysis.

    # (2) REWARD SHAPING — TRAINING ONLY. Added to the environment        #
    #     reward at each step. The leaderboard always scores the game's   #
    #     RAW utility u_i, so shaping only changes what your agent learns #
    #     to want, not how it is judged.                                  #
    #                                                                     #
    #     WHAT to reward is your Section 4 analysis. A safe form is       #
    #     potential-based shaping, F = gamma*Phi(s') - Phi(s), which      #
    #     telescopes over an episode and so provably leaves the optimal   #
    #     policy unchanged (Ng, Harada & Russell 1999); Phi is a function #
    #     YOU choose. A reward that does NOT telescope (e.g. a flat bonus #
    #     per stage survived) changes the objective and will train an     #
    #     agent that optimizes your bonus instead of the game.            #
